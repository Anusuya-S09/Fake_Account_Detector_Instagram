# Fake Social Media Account Detection System

## Overview
This project aims to develop an effective system for identifying fake social media accounts using a combination of image analysis, profile analysis, and activity analysis. The system leverages machine learning techniques and integrates with various social media platforms' APIs to assess the legitimacy of user accounts.

## Setup Instructions
To run the Fake Social Media Account Detection System, follow these steps:

### 1. Set up Virtual Environment
Create a virtual environment to isolate project dependencies.

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
```

Activate the virtual environment:

```bash
# For Linux/Mac
source venv/bin/activate

# For Windows
venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 2. Install Required Packages
Install the necessary packages using pip:

```bash
pip install django scikit-learn pandas instaloader
```

### 3. Running the System
Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd myproject
```

Run the Django server:

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

The system should now be accessible at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` in your web browser.

## Usage
Once the system is up and running, users can access the web interface to input social media account user name for analysis. The system will then process the information and provide an assessment of the account's legitimacy based on various criteria such as profile completeness, activity patterns, and engagement metrics.
